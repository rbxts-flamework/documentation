This is a compilation of frequently asked questions. If you have any question not listed here and you think it should be listed here, feel free to make a PR or ask in the roblox-ts discord.

### When do I use [`OnInit`](./guides/lifecycle-events#oninit-singletons) over [`OnStart`](./guides/lifecycle-events#onstart-singletons-components)?
You should prefer using `OnStart`, unless you need the unique behavior of `OnInit`.

### Should I commit `flamework.build` into Git?
No, this file is meant for storing information that Flamework needs between compiles and is generally discarded if it can be.

### Should I include `flamework.build` in my package?
Yes, you should include the file whenever you publish your package.

### Flamework cannot be built in a dirty environment.
This error occurs whenever you attempt to compile Flamework with incremental mode enabled in a project that was not previously using Flamework. You should delete your `out` directory which will cause TypeScript to completely recompile your project.
